                    Steve Jobs drove my diligence in writing tight elegant code back in the early days of Mac vs DOS. My career took a different direction and I have now just started writing apps for the iPhone. We have lost a giant.

                    I have a business in Australia and this business would never have existed without Apple. Apple has shown the way; the way to creative thinking, the way to inventive vision and creation, and the way to simplify and enhance our lives. I thank you Steve Jobs for your gifted mind and utterly dedicated spirit. And your ability to see things get done. Thanks also for showing us that companies don't have to be consumers of people. They can help people fly. It's so sad to hear of your untimely death but a reminder to us all that money cannot buy life. Go out and live. Steve would like that.

                    Steve, In a world of Chaos you showed us a beacon of simplicity and beauty. With Macbook Air you made us believe computers can be sexy again. You have done so much, so well. I wish you had stayed with us a little longer. You and Apple will be remembered.
